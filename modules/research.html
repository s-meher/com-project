      </p>

      <h2 id="getting-started">Getting Started</h2>
      <h3>Accessing Library Services</h3>
      <p>
        If you are a newly admitted student and you have not obtained an IIT Hawk Card, details for doing so can be found at the Hawk Card Homepage. You will need your Hawk Card number to access some library services
      </p>
      <p>
        Even if you don't have a Hawk Card, you can still access online journals and perform all of the search functions through the library website. You will only need your Hawk Card to check out materials in person at the Galvin Library or request materials through interlibrary loan. Let's take a look at how to get started.
      </p>

      <h3>Using myIIT to Access the Library Website</h3>
      <p>
        Although you can search for research materials through the library website directly, the best way to access the library website is to first log on to myIIT. Once you are logged in, you will see a link to "Library Resources." Try logging in, and clicking on that link.
      </p>

      <figure>
        <img src="../public/img/research2.jpg" alt="myIIT page with Library Resources link">
        <figcaption>CAPTION: The Library Services icon leads you to the library search website.</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>
        Accessing the library website through myIIT allows a proxy server connection which will enable you to access most resources without reentering your login information.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once you are at the library website, you will see a variety of search options available on the left-hand navigation bar.
      </p>
      <p>
        The best place to begin researching is in a scholarly database that allows you to search multiple scholarly journals at once, such as Academic Search Premiere (EBSCO).
      </p>

      <h2 id="timelines">Research Timelines</h2>
      <h3>Formulating a timeline</h3>
      <p>
        It is important to first consider your due date when thinking about requesting resources. You must have enough time to read the material, integrate it into your project or paper, and still have time to finish your assignment. In general, consider this formula when determining whether it is realistic to use a resource for your paper:
      </p>
      <p>Time to obtain resource + Time to read resource + Time to integrate resource into your project &lt; Remaining time before deadline</p>

      <p>Let's unpack some of those terms</p>
      <p><strong>Time to obtain resource:</strong> How long will it take for the resource to arrive via interlibrary loan? -or- How long will it take for you to physically obtain the resource?</p>
      <p><strong>Time to read resource:</strong> How long will it take you to read the book or article? Are you at a point in your project where you must begin to write if you want to finish on time?</p>
      <p><strong>Time to integrate resource into your project:</strong> Even if you are able to read the resource, do you have enough time to identify pertinent information and incorporate that information into your project? If your paper is already written, do you have enough time to restructure it to allow for discussion of this resource, or would it simply be better to indicate your awareness of the resource with an explanation that time constraints prevented you from including it?</p>
      <p><strong>Remaining time before deadline:</strong> How much time is left before you must turn in your project? Is your resource powerful enough to cause you to rethink your approach to your topic? If so, requesting an extension might be in order.</p>

      <aside class="callout" aria-label="Being Realistic">
        <h3>Being Realistic</h3>
        <p>Don't assume that you can read an entire scholarly book in one day. You're only fooling yourself and wasting your precious time if you try to obtain resources that you can't possibly hope to read within your research timeline.</p>
      </aside>

      <h3>Case Study: Example of a Research Timeline</h3>
      <p>
        Bridgette is a graduate student in the Tech Comm program who has been assigned a literature review and research paper for a graduate course. She's decided to research the development of technical communication as a field between the beginning of the twentieth century up to World War II.
      </p>
      <p>
        Her first move is to begin researching by logging into myIIT and searching for articles using scholarly databases like EBSCO and JSTOR. After conducting some research, she finds several articles that are pertinent to her search topic, but are not available as a .pdf download through those databases. She knows that she must decide whether it is worthwhile for her to request those resources or to move on and look for resources that are more easily available. To do this, she constructs a research timeline.
      </p>
      <p>
        Having conducted research projects before, she knows that she need not write down her timeline, but she decides to set reasonable goals and record them in her Google calendar so that she has an idea of when certain elements of her project should be completed. She first concludes that she has started with plenty of time to request any resources that she needs to complete the project, and that she will have sufficient time to wait for resources to arrive, read them, and incorporate what she has learned into her paper before she must turn in her final copy. She decides to read these articles when they arrive, and then expand her research to cover her topic as appropriate.
      </p>

      <h3>Determining the best way to obtain resources</h3>
      <p>
        Even if you can obtain a resource, that doesn't mean you necessarily should spend your time doing so. Be sure to preview a resource by reading a book review or previewing the book on Google Books to make sure that it is valuable enough to obtain. If you have determined that it is feasible and worthwhile to obtain a resource within the timeline you have developed, you must next consider how to obtain that resource.
      </p>
      <p>
        In general, the safest way to obtain resources is to physically obtain a copy yourself. However, that is often inconvenient, impractical, or unnecessary. In cases such as those, interlibrary loan or MyILL is your best option. However, interlibrary loan can take time. Consider these guidelines when requesting your resource through interlibrary loan or MyILL.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>The stated turnaround time</li>
        <li>Problems can and do occur in transmitting library materials...</li>
        <li>The proximity of the lending library to your location.</li>
        <li>In the case of MyILL, articles are delivered exclusively online...</li>
        <li>The possibility that your materials may not arrive before your deadline</li>
        <li>Can you complete your project without these materials? ...</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 id="requesting-resources">Requesting Resources</h2>
      <h3>Requesting Articles</h3>
      <p>Occasionally, you will notice that some articles are not available for download as a .pdf file...</p>

      <figure>
        <img src="../public/img/research4_image1.jpg" alt="Database result with Get Article option">
        <figcaption>CAPTION NOT AVAILABLE</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>Clicking on the Get Article link will direct you to a page like this...</p>

      <figure>
        <img src="../public/img/research4_image2.jpg" alt="Request screen in MyILL">
        <figcaption>CAPTION: For this resource, the only option is to request the article through MyILL</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>Your myILL account requires a separate setup from your myIIT account...</p>

      <h3>Requesting a Book From Another Library</h3>
      <p>When searching for a book, it is best to begin by searching the IIT library system...</p>

      <aside class="callout" aria-label="Being Realistic">
        <h3>Being Realistic</h3>
        <p>When collecting resources, don't assume that you will remember any of the titles...</p>
      </aside>

      <p>If you are confused when using any of the library systems...</p>

      <h3>Case Study: Searching and Requesting Resources</h3>
      <p>Bridgette receives the articles that she has requested and reads through them...</p>

      <h2 id="local-libraries">Local Libraries</h2>
      <p>There are two types of local libraries that may contain your resources:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Other university libraries belonging to I-Share</li>
        <li>Public libraries</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>I-Share Libraries</h3>
      <p>Many I-Share libraries will allow you to pull books directly from the shelf...</p>
      <p>Not all area libraries belong to the I-Share system...</p>

      <aside class="callout" aria-label="Being Realistic">
        <h3>Being Realistic</h3>
        <p>Don't waste your research time by making the trip to a library only to find out it is closed...</p>
      </aside>

      <p>If you plan on visiting an I-Share library to obtain your resource, consider the following:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Where is the library located?</li>
        <li>Will you have to travel outside of Chicago? If so, consider interlibrary loan.</li>
        <li>Can you enter the library?</li>
        <li>Ask if the library is open to the public...</li>
        <li>What are the library hours?</li>
        <li>Not every institution uses the semester system...</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Public Libraries</h3>
      <p>The Chicago Public Library (CPL) system is extensive...</p>

      <h3>Case Study: Obtaining a Resource from an I-Share Library</h3>
      <p>After finishing another project, Bridgette returns to her research paper...</p>

      <h3>When to Use Local Library Resources Instead of Interlibrary Loan</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>You no longer have enough time to wait for an interlibrary loan book to be delivered</li>
        <li>You cannot obtain the book through interlibrary loan because it is not available</li>
      </ul>
      <p>It is important to remember that CPL volumes are not listed in I-Share...</p>
      <p>In the final section of this lesson we'll explore the best way to obtain resources, the internet.</p>

      <h2 id="internet-resources">Internet Resources</h2>
      <h3>Some resources to consider</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Public domain writings</li>
        <li>Resources licensed under Creative Commons</li>
        <li>Media files such as video, audio, and images</li>
      </ul>
      <p>In general, if you can avoid making a trip to the library, you can save yourself time when researching</p>

      <h3>Using Web Resources for Research</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="https://scholar.google.com/">Google Scholar</a> - Allows you to search for scholarly articles and view which articles are cited by other articles</li>
        <li><a href="https://books.google.com/">Google Books</a> - Allows you to view a preview of a book, or in some cases, the entire book, including the references section</li>
        <li><a href="https://www.webofscience.com/">Web of Science</a> - Similar to Google Scholar, but for scientific papers</li>
      </ul>

      <aside class="callout" aria-label="Being Realistic">
        <h3>Being Realistic</h3>
        <p>If you're stuck when researching a topic in Technical Communication, try searching for a special issue...</p>
      </aside>

      <h3>Case Study: Using Web Resources</h3>
      <p>Near the completion of her research project, Bridgette starts to question some of the arguments...</p>

      <h3>That's it!</h3>
      <p>
        Hopefully you learned a little bit about conducting research and obtaining resources...
